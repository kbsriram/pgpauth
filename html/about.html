          This is a small service that works like a PGP key server, except it uses OAuth to verify PGP userids before adding them into its database.</p>
        <p>So it behaves as a database of OAuth-checked public keys for facebook, twitter, g+, gmail users and so on.  It also has <a href="api.html">convenient web APIs</a> for applications to add or search for keys, which I hope makes it more web-developer friendly.

        <a rel="me" href="https://plus.google.com/102207019656909757485" title="KB Sriram at G+">I'm KB</a>, a software developer. I wrote this as a small step to help create systems that let us communicate more securely, using our online identities and over existing services.
        </p>
        <p>
One application might be a tool that lets (say) facebook users exchange <a href="http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=18229">encrypted content</a> through the sharer's dropbox account. If the recipients share their public keys, the sharer can encrypt the material so that only the recipients can use it.</p>
        <p>This would let us securely share privacy-sensitive material like photos of children, medical data and so on. We could still use our online identities, but keep such content on storage we control, and secure it from everyone but the actual recipients.</p>

        <p>It would be nice if there was an existing, reliable way for an identity provider to publish a public key for their users. But could a third-party service use the more common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> to bridge the gap instead? By verifying user id data in a PGP key against information available with OAuth, it would at least avoid casually inserting forged user ids into the system.
        </p>

        <p>Which finally brings me to this site.  I coded a simple appengine service that does just that. It's a place to store and find PGP keys for online identities. However, it adds an OAuth verification step before adding a key, so while you'd still want to independently verify PGP keys the usual way, it raises the bar by that much.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/kbsriram/pgpauth">code is on github</a>. You are free to reuse any bits in your own services if you prefer, make it better, anything really.
        </p>

        <p>The site currently handles PGP public keys with Gmail or Yahoo email addresses, and Facebook,Twitter or Google+ keys that use <a href="api.html#purl">profile URLs</a>.
