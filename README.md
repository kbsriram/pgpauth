OpenPGPAuth
===========

[OpenPGPAuth](https://pgpauth.appspot.com) is a small appengine service
that is functionally like a PGP key server, but uses OAuth to validate
keys before adding it to the database.

Feel free to use the service directly, or any part of this code you
find useful within your own application or service.
